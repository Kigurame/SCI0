Documentation for SCPP, a pretty printer for SCRIPT code

SCPP is a pretty-printer for SCI code; or, more accurately speaking, a 
pretty-indenter. SCPP.BAT is a batch file that makes use of SCPPRINT.EXE, 
which is a Unix style filter that will strip all leading blank space off of 
every line and replace it with tab characters. It will not alter a file's 
line breaks, just indent based on parenthesis nesting.

Usage: scpp <filename> [<extension>]
       default extension is .SC

SCPP will save the original file with extension .BAK and replace it 
with a properly indented version. During run time it uses a temporary file 
with extension .TMP.
